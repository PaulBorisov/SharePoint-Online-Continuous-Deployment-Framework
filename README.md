# SharePoint-Online-Continuous-Deployment-Framework
SPO-CDF is a simple provisioning framework for SharePoint Online that represents a lightweight and less demanding alternative to Provider-hosted Add-Ins. 
It supports both ways of deployment, the modern one based on the remote provisioning of customizations and the legacy feature based framework of "no code" sandbox solutions. 

SPO-CDF provides quick path to apply automated branding and customizations to newly created and already existing site collections in the minimal amount of time. 
In addition, it supports postponed creation of site collections from all standard and configurable custom web-templates via a familiar OOB UI (slightly adjusted).

More detailed descriptions of SPO-CDF can be found in the supplemental document "SharePoint-Online-Continuous-Deployment-Framework.docx".
